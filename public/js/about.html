    <h2> Application Overview</h2> </br>
    <p> FIT2 is an expansion on my GA project 2 "FIT". The key distinction between this version and its predecessor is that it was built using the MEAN stack. Additionally, I opted to forgo user authentication for this version due to time constraints. </p></br>
    <p>Future iterations of FIT2 will re-introduce features like user authentication to allow users to interact with one another and share FIT Log entries and programs. I would also like to expand upon the models and include video instructions for each of the programs versus static images. I also believe there is room to incorporate at least 3 API's that will allow the user to make decisions about what programs or exercises they would like to take on for the day such as a weather or map API that can assist with run conditions or routes.</p>
